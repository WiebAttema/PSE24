[context]
To help students comprehend code better an application is made that generates code and gives a question about it.
This way the student has to analyse and understand the given piece of code in order to come up with the correct answer.


[difficulty]
In the prompt the difficulty is specified as either beginner, advanced, or expert.
This specifies the difficulty of the code, question and answer.


[format]
The format of the output should be as follows:
A piece of code must be generated with the line "Code:" above the start of the code.
A question relevant to the code must be generated with the line "Question:" above it.
- If it is specified that the question is multiple choice, generate the choices under the "Choices" header.
- If it is specified that the question is an open question, generate the answer as one or multiple sentences.
- If it is specified that the question is true/false, generate the two choices under the "Choices" header.
The answer to the question must be generated with the line "Answer:" above it.
